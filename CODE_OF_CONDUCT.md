# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

CICULLIS is not a social space.
It is an **enforcement system**.

This Code of Conduct exists to preserve:
- determinism
- accountability
- finality
- signal clarity

Behavior that undermines these properties is out of scope.

---

## Expected Behavior

Participants must:

- Communicate precisely and concretely
- Make falsifiable claims
- Provide evidence when asserting correctness or failure
- Accept enforcement outcomes as non-personal
- Respect that silence, closure, or refusal are valid responses

Technical disagreement is acceptable.
Narrative pressure is not.

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following are not permitted:

- Speculation presented as fact
- Requests for exceptions, flexibility, or overrides
- Attempts to negotiate enforcement semantics
- Emotional, rhetorical, or persuasive pressure
- Reframing enforcement outcomes as interpersonal conflict
- Repeated reopening of settled decisions

CICULLIS does not adjudicate intent.
Only observable behavior matters.

---

## Scope

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem necessary to preserve

---

## Responsibility Boundary

Participation is voluntary.

By engaging with this repository, you accept that:
- enforcement outcomes are final

If this posture is unacceptable, do not participate.
